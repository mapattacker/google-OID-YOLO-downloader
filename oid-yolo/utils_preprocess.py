        IsGroupOf (bool): Indicates that the box spans a group of objects (e.g., a bed of flowers or a crowd of people). We asked annotators to use this tag for cases with more than 5 instances which are heavily occluding each other and are physically touching.
        IsDepiction (bool): Indicates that the object is a depiction (e.g., a cartoon or drawing of the object, not a real physical instance).
